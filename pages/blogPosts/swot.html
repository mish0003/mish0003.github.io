                <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I feel confident in coding, problem-solving, and teamwork because I have actively developed
                        these
                        skills
                        through my hobbies and projects. For example, coding as a hobby has helped me become
                        comfortable
                        learning new programming languages and has taught me how to approach complex challenges
                        methodically.
                        Problem-solving is something I enjoy, whether it involves debugging code, tackling problems
                        in
                        math
                        or
                        physics, or strategizing during a game of chess. Teamwork is another area I am constantly
                        improving,
                        as
                        I have collaborated on various projects, such as websites and presentations, and I regularly
                        participate
                        in team sports. I also consider myself adaptable, which allows me to handle new situations
                        and
                        overcome
                        setbacks effectively.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="swot-att">
                <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One weakness I am aware of is procrastination, especially when it comes to tasks that I find
                        less
                        interesting. I try to overcome this by breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable
                        pieces.
                        Another
                        weakness is that I sometimes get frustrated if things do not work out as I expected on the
                        first
                        try. I
                        first noticed this while learning to drive. However, I have realized that persistence and a
                        step-by-step
                        approach usually lead to better outcomes, so I am working on adopting a more patient
                        mindset.

                <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I feel that the opportunities this ICT program will open are immense. For me, access to
                        resources,
                        experienced mentors, and networking opportunities with a strong pool of peers who share
                        similar
                        interests is invaluable. With the skills I gain and the learning during college, I can
                        imagine
                        exploring
                        artificial intelligence or even starting a tech business with fellow students on campus. The
                        program’s
                        focus on practical learning will prepare me to tackle real-world challenges and see where my
                        efforts
                        can
                        take me.</li>

                <h3>Threats</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>My main concern is the competitive job market in the tech industry. To stand out, I know
                        I’ll
                        need
                        to
                        constantly improve my skills and stay up-to-date with industry trends. While it’s a
                        challenge, I
                        see
                        it
                        as motivation to push myself and take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the
                        program.
