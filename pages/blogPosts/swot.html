                    <h3>Strengths</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I feel confident in coding, problem-solving, and teamwork because I have actively developed
                            these
                            skills
                            through my hobbies and projects. For example, coding as a hobby has helped me become
                            comfortable
                            learning new programming languages and has taught me how to approach complex challenges
                            methodically.
                            Problem-solving is something I enjoy, whether it involves debugging code, tackling problems
                            in
                            math
                            or
                            physics, or strategizing during a game of chess. Teamwork is another area I am constantly
                            improving,
                            as
                            I have collaborated on various projects, such as websites and presentations, and I regularly
                            participate
                            in team sports. I also consider myself adaptable, which allows me to handle new situations
                            and
                            overcome
                            setbacks effectively.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="swot-att">
                    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One weakness I am aware of is procrastination, especially when it comes to tasks that I find
                            less
                            interesting. I try to overcome this by breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable
                            pieces.
                            Another
                            weakness is that I sometimes get frustrated if things do not work out as I expected on the
                            first
                            try. I
                            first noticed this while learning to drive. However, I have realized that persistence and a
                            step-by-step
                            approach usually lead to better outcomes, so I am working on adopting a more patient
                            mindset.

                    <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I feel that the opportunities this ICT program will open are immense. For me, access to
                            resources,
                            experienced mentors, and networking opportunities with a strong pool of peers who share
                            similar
                            interests is invaluable. With the skills I gain and the learning during college, I can
                            imagine
                            exploring
                            artificial intelligence or even starting a tech business with fellow students on campus. The
                            program’s
                            focus on practical learning will prepare me to tackle real-world challenges and see where my
                            efforts
                            can
                            take me.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="swot-att">
                    <h3>Threats</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My main concern is the competitive job market in the tech industry. To stand out, I know
                            I’ll
                            need
                            to
                            constantly improve my skills and stay up-to-date with industry trends. While it’s a
                            challenge, I
                            see
                            it
                            as motivation to push myself and take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the
                            program.
