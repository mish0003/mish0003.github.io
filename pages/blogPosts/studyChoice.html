                    <ul>
                        <li>ICT appeals to me because it allows me to combine logical reasoning, creativity, and a
                            passion for solving problems. My background in mathematics, physics, and IT gave me a strong
                            technical base, and I’ve enjoyed extending that knowledge by experimenting with new tools
                            and developing projects of my own. Outside of academics, activities such as chess strengthen
                            my ability to think several steps ahead, while sports like football, volleyball, and working
                            out at the gym have instilled teamwork, resilience, and persistence — qualities I believe
                            are essential in the ICT world.</li>

                <h1>My choice based on external factors</h1>
                <section>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I found about the program through webinars, organizations such
                            as APV and Unify, current HZ students and carefully
                            reviewed all the information on the university’s official website.
                            What draws me to HZ’s ICT program is its focus on practical, real-world learning. I look
                            forward to collaborating with other students, gaining guidance from mentors, and making
                            full
                            use of the resources available. I’m especially curious about the potential of artificial
                            intelligence and inspired by the idea of turning innovative concepts into real solutions
                            through a student startup. Even though the technology sector is competitive, I see that
                            as
                            motivation to stay ambitious, keep learning, and push myself to grow into a capable ICT
                            professional.
